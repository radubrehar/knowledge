## Day 1 - 2018-12-10

visit https://ocaml.org/ and install from https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html - using the OPAM installation instructions https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html

Going through the OCAML manual at http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/index.html and also found https://try.ocamlpro.com/ and going through lessons 1 to 4. Found tryocaml site very straightforward and useful tips - you probably get those in the ocaml manual as well, but the tryocaml site has them more condensed

Up to this point, I found the language pleasant to write - even though I mostly played with the REPL - `exit 0;;` to exit the repl

Planning to learn OCAML and Reason/ReasonReact
